     Hello World!I live in St. Louis, Missouri.  I was born and raised here and then came back to Missouri to be closer to my family. I have a small farm in Moberly, Missouri.  Recently, my dad died and my mom suffered a stroke.  I am caring for her while she recovers.  My friend in Moberly cares for my residence and my farm pets in my absence.  COVID-19 has impacted my stay indefinitely.
I went to Saint Louis University and received a BA in Political Science and then moved to Omaha, Nebraska to obtain my Juris Doctor. I now attend Mizzou to pursue further my education.  I have limited knowledge of web application/development. I hope to learn basic skills by taking this course.
I love spending time with family and friends.  Walking my dogs and watching the sunset are some of my favorite activities.
Liz
