<h3>Learning Tort Law is Interesting</h3>
<h4>By Elizabeth Schilling, JD</h4>

    <p>As a citizen, teacher and lawyer, I believe that learning the fundamentals of tort law is invaluable.  Torts is an area of law that some find not to be as sweet as tarts.  However, my goal is to help make this a sweet learning experience.  In the end, you will find that there are almost as many flavors of tarts as there are of areas of tort law. There is a tort that will surely satisfy your taste in the law.<p>
    
    <p> I have been a lawyer for over 20 years.  I received my Juris Doctor (law degree) from Creighton University in 1987.  Over the years, I have taught law at the community college level.  Additionally, I have trained new lawyers, interns and paralegals about torts and the practice of law.  I've been told that I am a good teacher. 
        
    <p>I hope that this course will enhance your ability to legally analyze situations and appreciate tort law.</p>
