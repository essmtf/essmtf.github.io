<h3>The <em>Basics</em> of <em>Tort</em> Law</h3>
    <br>
     <p>Welcome to Introduction to Torts.  Torts is an area of law and unfortunately is not as sweet as tarts.  However, my goal is to help make this a sweet learning experience.  In the end, you will find that there are almost as many flavors of tarts as there are of areas of tort law.<p><br>
     <p> I have been a lawyer for over 20 years.  I received my Juris Doctor (law degree) from Creighton University in 1987.  Over the years, I have taught law at the community college level.  Additionally, I have trained new lawyers, interns and paralegals about torts and the practice of law.  I've been told that I am a good teacher. <bt></bt>I hope that this course will enhance your ability to legally analyze situations and appreciate tort law.<p/><br>
