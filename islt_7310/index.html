    <h1>Welcome to Tort Law</h1>
    <h3>This course is an Introduction to Tort Law.</h3><p>This course will explore the many types of civil actions in Tort Law. There are two types of law-criminal law and civil law. Tort law is a collection of civil legal actions that focuses on financially compensating the person who was injured by the actions of another person.  Criminal law is based on punishing a wrongdoer for his committed against society by harming another person.</p>
    
   <p>One popular tort action is negligence. Let’s suppose Sleepy Sidney drives his car into Alert Allison’s car. Sleepy Sidney was changing lanes but didn’t see Alert Allison and caused her to run into a pole.  As a result, Alert Allison’s car was damaged and she had to go to the hospital for injuries where her head hit the steering wheel.  Alert Allison could sue Sleepy Sidney for monetary damages related to the car accident. </p>
